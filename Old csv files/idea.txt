        # Write following info for each row

    # Should rewrite the file by renaming the temp file the same name as original file.
    # shutil.move(temp_file.name, filename)
# ------ My Idea ------
# Store array of names without repeating repeated entries
    # Go through each row containing the specified name as selected in the array
        # Append specified info to selected string variable for column we want to append to
